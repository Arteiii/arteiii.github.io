## The Shell

In Linux systems, the default shell, which is the command interpreter that allows users to interact with the operating system,
is often the Bourne Again Shell (BASH).  
However, there are alternatives such as the Korn Shell (KSH), ZSH, and others.

When you first open a terminal, you'll see a prompt that typically consists of the current username followed by the hostname,
then the current directory (often represented by `~` indicating the home directory of the user),
and finally a '`$`' symbol for regular users or `#` for the root user.

For example:

- Regular user prompt: `arteii@centre:~$`
- Root user prompt: `root@centre:~#`

If you wish to customize this prompt, you can modify the PS1 environment variable.  
This variable controls the appearance of the prompt. Here's an example of modifying the prompt to display the date, time, username, hostname, current directory, and a symbol representing the user's permissions:

    ```bash
    PS1="[\d \t \u@\h:\W\$] "
    ```

After setting this, your prompt will display like this:

    ```shell
    [Tue Jun 11 18:24:29 root@centre:~$]
    ```

This prompt customization is useful for personalizing your command line interface and making it more informative or visually appealing.
Feel free to experiment with different configurations to find one that suits your preferences.

## Commands

In Linux, a command refers to any file with executable privileges.  
These files can be programs, scripts, or utilities that perform specific tasks when invoked.

For example, running `man ls` in the terminal returns the documentation for the `ls` command,
which is used to list files and directories.  
The documentation typically shows the command's syntax, options, and usage.

For ls, the syntax is:

    ```bash
    ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
    ```

Here, the square brackets `[]` indicate that the `options` and `file` arguments are optional.

Options for commands often come in short and long forms. For instance, `-h` and `--help` are short and long forms for displaying help information.  
Similarly, `ls -a` and `ls --all` both list all files in the current directory, including hidden ones.

Another command, `rm` (remove), is used for deleting files or directories.  
For example:

    ```bash
    rm -file
    ```

In this case, the command fails with an error message because it interprets `-file` as an option, not a filename.

To avoid this, you can use the `--` (double dash) to signify the end of options and treat subsequent arguments as filenames.  
For instance:

    ```bash
    rm -- -file
    ```

Additionally, you can activate logging for a command using the `-v` (verbose) option.  
This can be helpful for debugging and identifying errors.

In some cases, programs do not follow these conventions, so it's best to consult the documentation for these tools.
