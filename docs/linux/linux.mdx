## History

In 1983, Richard Stallman initiated the GNU Project with the aim of creating a free Unix-like operating system. Meanwhile, Linus Torvalds independently developed the Linux kernel in 1991.

At that time, various Unix-based operating systems existed, including proprietary ones like UnixWare by Novell and SunOS by Sun Microsystems, as well as open-source alternatives like BSD from the University of California, Berkeley.

## Why GNU/Linux?

- **Kernel**: A kernel serves as the core of an operating system, managing system resources and facilitating interaction between software and hardware.

- **GNU Tools**: These encompass compilers, text editors, and other essential utilities vital for operating a Unix-like system.

## Combining Forces

GNU/Linux emerged through the amalgamation of the Linux kernel and GNU tools. Torvalds' kernel provided core functionality and hardware support, while Stallman's GNU tools furnished a comprehensive suite of software for system administration and programming.

By blending these components, GNU/Linux offers a complete, free, and open-source operating system. This collaboration epitomizes the ethos of open-source development, yielding a robust platform utilized worldwide for its versatility and accessibility.

## Distributions (distros)

They bundle the Linux kernel, GNU tools, and additional software into user-friendly packages.
Each distro offers different features, tailored to specific needs.

Of course, the preceding distros are absolutely not ordered based on how much I like them :3  
they're all just equally fantastic, right?

### [NixOS](https://nixos.org/)

Sponsored by [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/), openSUSE is a versatile distribution suitable for desktops, servers, and development environments.
It offers two main editions: Leap, which follows a stable release model similar to Debian,
and Tumbleweed, which provides rolling updates with the latest software versions.
openSUSE is known for its powerful YaST configuration tool and robust package management system.

### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)

Designed to be user-friendly and familiar for Windows users, Linux Mint provides a polished desktop experience out of the box.
It's based on Ubuntu and offers several desktop environments, including Cinnamon and Xfce.
Linux Mint is popular among users looking for a seamless transition to Linux.

### [Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)](https://www.redhat.com/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux)

Developed by Red Hat, RHEL is a leading enterprise-focused distribution known for its stability, security, and long-term support.
It's designed to meet the needs of businesses and organizations with critical workloads, providing a reliable platform for mission-critical applications.

### [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)

Known for its simplicity, minimalism, and flexibility,
Arch Linux is a distribution that appeals to experienced users who prefer to build their system from the ground up.
It follows a rolling release model, providing the latest software updates continuously.
Arch Linux offers extensive customization options but requires more manual configuration compared to other distros.

### Release Cycles

GNU/Linux distributions vary in how frequently they release updates, which impacts both stability and access to new features.

#### Long Release Cycle

Distributions like Ubuntu LTS and Debian Stable have longer release cycles, with updates spaced out over months or even years.
This ensures stability and reliability, making them suitable for production environments and users who prioritize consistency.

#### Short Release Cycle

Other distros, such as Fedora and Ubuntu non-LTS, have shorter release cycles, with updates pushed more frequently, typically every few months.
While this allows users to access new features sooner, it may introduce more frequent changes and potential instability, especially in bleeding-edge software.

:::info
Choosing between release cycles involves balancing the need for stability with the desire for cutting-edge features.

Longer release cycles provide stability but may lag behind in feature updates.
Shorter release cycles offer newer features but may require more frequent updates and potentially introduce instability.
The choice depends on users' preferences and the specific requirements of their use case.
