# Introduction to Assembly Language Programming

Assembly language is a low-level programming language that closely corresponds to the architecture of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Unlike high-level languages, such as C++ or Python, which are designed for human readability and abstraction, assembly language provides a direct interface with the computer's hardware.

In assembly language, programs are written using symbolic representations of the machine instructions executed by the CPU. Each assembly instruction corresponds to a specific operation at the hardware level, making it a powerful tool for understanding and controlling a computer's behavior.

## Key Concepts

### Registers

Assembly language relies heavily on registers, which are small, fast storage locations within the CPU. Registers store data temporarily during program execution.

### Instructions

Assembly instructions are mnemonics that represent specific operations. Examples include MOV (move data), ADD (addition), and JMP (jump to a different part of the program).

### Memory Access

Assembly language allows direct manipulation of memory. Operations like loading data from memory (MOV), storing data to memory (MOV), and accessing specific memory addresses are fundamental.

### Condition Codes

Flags or condition codes indicate the status of the CPU after an operation. Common flags include zero, carry, and overflow flags.

### Control Flow

Control flow instructions, such as jumps (JMP) and branches (JZ - jump if zero), determine the flow of execution based on specific conditions.

## Example

```asm6502
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, Assembly World!',0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; Write the message to standard output
    mov eax, 4            ; system call for sys_write
    mov ebx, 1            ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, msg          ; pointer to the message
    mov edx, 23           ; message length
    int 0x80              ; call kernel

    ; Exit the program
    mov eax, 1            ; system call for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx          ; exit code 0
    int 0x80              ; call kernel
```

This simple example prints "Hello, Assembly World!" to the console and exits. Each line corresponds to a specific assembly instruction, providing a glimpse into the direct interaction between the program and the underlying hardware.
