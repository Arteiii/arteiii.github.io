# Sequential Datatypes

## Indexing

the characters of a string are numbered from left to right starting with 0
from the back (right) you start counting with -1
this can be done with: []

```py
>>> text = "Hello World!"
>>> print(text[0])
H
>>> print(text[6])
W

>>> print(text[-4])
r

>>> print(text[-1])
!
```

This works for all sequential data types, including lists and tuples:

```py
>>> l = [42, 3, [6, 9]]
>>> l[0]
42
>>> l[2]
[6, 9]

>>> l[2][1]
9

>>> l[0] = "new value"
>>> l
['new value', 3, [6, 9]]
```

**tuples cannot be changed**

## len Function

The len function reproduces the number of elements of a sequential data type

```py
>>> string = 'Hello World!'
>>> len(string)
12

>>> list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
>>> len(list)
7
```

## Lists

unlike a string, lists consist of a sequence of arbitrary objects
for example integer-numbers,float-numbers, strings or again lists

```py
>>> x = [3, 6, 9, "der traum ist echt"]
>>> y = [42, 44, [45, 89], 88]
```

as you can see lists are generated with the square bracket[] and separated with commas

lists can contain further sub-lists like in example y
but also other objects for example tuples and dictionaries

## Strings

strings consist of an unchanging sequence of characters

this can be done for example with: '

```py
'im a string'
```

or: "

```py
"also a string"
```

works also """ or '''

```py
'''bli bla blub string "this works btw" '''
```

to create multiline strigns offers: \

```py
>>> s = "string string \
  but i go over several lines \
  this is the first line \n\
  and this the second"
>>> print(s)
```

to create a line feed we use: \n

an alternative would be to use the """ but here newlines are taken over into the string

```py
>>> s = """string string
  but i go over several lines
  this is the third line \
  i also belong to the third"""
>>> print(s)
```

sometimes you don't want python to express these escape characters
this can be done by defining a python string as a "raw" string (r/R)

```py
>>> s = "\one line\aandanother one"
>>> print(s)
one line
andanother one

>>> s = r"\one line\aandanother one"
>>> print(s)
\one line\aandanother one

>>> s = R"\one line\aandanother one"
>>> print(s)
\one line\aandanother one
```

[Almost Everything About Strings](#almost-everything-about-strings)

## subdivision operators

As with indexing, the angular clips were used in slicing
Only here are at the beginning and end of the value

```py
>>> txt = 'Hello World'
>>> txt[1:4]
'ell'
>>> txt[0:5]
'Hello'
```

<br />
you can also leave out the initial or end value

```py
>>> txt[:5]
'Hello'

>>> txt[0:-6]
'Hello'
```

<br />
of course also works the other way around:

```py
>>> txt[6:]
'World'
```

<br />
So it would work with lists:

```py
>>> liste = [1, 2, 3, 42, 369]
>>> liste[1:3]
[2, 3]

>>> liste[2:]
[3, 42, 369]

>>> liste[:4]
[1, 2, 3, 42]
```

<br />

the slicing operator also works with 3 arguments
[Beginning, end, step size]Â²

```py
>>> k = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
>>> k[0:11:3]
[1, 4, 7, 10]


>>> text = 'Python is fun! Hello World!'

>>> text[::3]
'Ph  nHlWl'
```

also works:)

works with negative values
The meaning of the values changes:
[End, beginning, negative step size]
If no initial and final value has been given, the list with reverse order is issued:

```py
>>> x = [3, 6, 9, 42, 35]
>>> x[3:1:-1]
[42, 9]

>>> x[4:1:-2]
[35, 9]

>>> l = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
>>> l[::-1]
[11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Tuple

lists and tuples differ only in the way they are parenthesized
so if we want to use the list example in a tuple notation it looks like this:

```py
>>> x = (3, 6, 9, "der traum ist echt")
>>> y = (42, 44, [45, 89], 88)
```

<br />

The biggest difference is that tuples can no longer be changed!
so no object can be removed added or changed

the bracket can also be omitted:

```py
>>> example = 3, 6, 9, "der traum ist echt"
>>> example
(3, 6, 9, 'der traum ist echt')
```

<br />

multiple assignment
instead of one variable name, list as many variable names on the left side of the assignment as the tuple element has

```py
>>> minimum, maximum, text = 42, 369, "der traum ist echt"
>>> minimum
42
>>> maximum
369
>>> text
'der traum ist echt'
```
