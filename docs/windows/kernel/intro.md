## Tools

To get started with driver development, simply follow the MSDN guide. Don't forget to install the "Debugging Tools for Windows" during the Windows SDK installation

[MSDN GUIDE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

You'll find the [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/) tools to be quite helpful. Simply download the [SysinternalsSuite](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip) and unzip it

To test and debug your drivers, you will use a VM. I will use VMware, but feel free to use any software that you prefer. Please refer to your VM's documentation for specific steps, as they may vary.
