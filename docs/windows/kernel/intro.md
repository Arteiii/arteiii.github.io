# Intro

Developing a Windows kernel driver is essential for tasks like hardware interaction, performance optimization,  
security software creation, virtualization support, implementing custom system services, and achieving real-time processing.  

Kernel drivers operate with higher privileges, directly interacting with the kernel for tasks like hardware management,  
offering superior performance. However, they require meticulous security considerations to prevent system instability,  
unlike user-mode applications, which are more isolated and less prone to impacting system integrity.


## Prerequisites

To get started with driver development, simply follow the MSDN guide. Don't forget to install the "Debugging Tools for Windows" during the Windows SDK installation

[MSDN GUIDE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

Additionally, it is recommended to download the [SysinternalsSuite](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip) by [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/)  

I will be using VMware to test and debug drivers, but feel free to use whatever software you prefer. Please refer to your VM's documentation for specific steps, as they may vary
