## Read

## Tools

To get started with driver development, simply follow the MSDN guide. Don't forget to install the "Debugging Tools for Windows" during the Windows SDK installation

[MSDN GUIDE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk)

You'll find the [Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/) tools to be quite helpful. Simply download the [SysinternalsSuite](https://download.sysinternals.com/files/SysinternalsSuite.zip) and unzip it

I will be using VMware to test and debug drivers, but feel free to use whatever software you prefer. Please refer to your VM's documentation for specific steps, as they may vary
