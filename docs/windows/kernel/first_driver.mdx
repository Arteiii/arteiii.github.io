# First Kernel Mode Driver

If you have accurately followed the installation instructions outlined in the [introduction](./index.md),  
you should find the "Kernel Mode Driver, Empty" template in Visual Studio  
Create a new project using this preset

![Kernel Mode Driver, Empty](img/devenv_N2bwT42RVY.png)

In the "Driver Files" section, locate the `.inf` file and delete it  
Afterward, create a new C++ source file with the name of your driver, for example, `test_driver.cpp`

---

The `ntddk.h` header file provides essential functionality and structures required for developing kernel-mode drivers.

```cpp
#include <ntddk.h>
```

[Learn more about the ntddk.h header file on Microsoft’s documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/)

## Driver Entry

```cpp
extern "C" NTSTATUS
DriverEntry(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject, _In_ PUNICODE_STRING RegistryPath)
{
  return STATUS_SUCCESS;
}

```


- `extern "C"` is a C++ language feature that specifies the function should be treated as if
it were declared in the C programming language.
[Learn more about `extern "C"` and function declarations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/extern-cpp#extern-c-and-extern-c-function-declarations).

- `NTSTATUS` is a data type representing the status of an operation in Windows kernel programming.
It is a `LONG` value where zero typically indicates success, and non-zero values indicate various error conditions.
[See more on `NTSTATUS` values](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/using-ntstatus-values).

- `DriverEntry` is the entry point for Windows kernel-mode drivers.
The operating system calls this function after loading the driver
to initialize its data structures and perform setup tasks.
[Read more about the `DriverEntry` function for KMDF drivers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/driverentry-for-kmdf-drivers).

- `PDRIVER_OBJECT` is a pointer to a structure that represents a driver in the Windows kernel.
[Explore the `DRIVER_OBJECT` structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/ns-wdm-_driver_object).

- `PUNICODE_STRING` is a pointer to a structure representing a Unicode string in the Windows kernel,
often used to reference a registry path relevant to the driver.
[Learn more about the `UNICODE_STRING` structure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/ntdef/ns-ntdef-_unicode_string).

:::info The Source Annotation Language (SAL)
annotations like `_In_` and `_Out_` are not strictly required for compilation
but are recommended to improve code clarity
and help static analysis tools understand the intended use of function parameters.

- `_In_` indicates that the parameter is an input to the function and shouldn’t be modified by the function.
- `_Out_` specifies that the parameter is used to return data from the function to the caller.

These annotations enhance code readability and can help catch potential bugs during development.
[Learn more about SAL and its uses](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal).

## Driver Unload

To ensure proper memory management, we will define a function that automatically undoes all changes made by the driver
upon unloading. This will prevent any potential leaks from persisting beyond the driver's use.

```cpp
void
TestUnload(_In_ PDRIVER_OBJECT DriverObject)
{
}
```

the pointer to the unload function must be set using the DriverUnload member of the DriverObject

```cpp
DriverObject->DriverUnload = TestUnload;
```

## Simple Debug Output

### DbgPrint

```cpp
DbgPrint("Output\n");
```

`DbgPrint` It allows you to print messages to the debugger output in both types of builds

### KdPrint

```cpp
KdPrint(("Output\n"));
```

`KdPrint` is often implemented as a macro, and it is typically included in debug builds but excluded in release builds

## Starting the Driver

To enable driver testing on your test machine, you’ll need to activate test-signing mode.
This allows the installation and running of unsigned drivers:

```cmd
bcdedit /set testsigning on
```

Next, create the driver service using the `sc` (Service Control) command:

```cmd
sc create <drivername> type= kernel binpath= "<path to driver.sys>"
```

To start the driver, use the following command:

```cmd
sc start <drivername>
```

You can stop the driver with:

```cmd
sc stop <drivername>
```

If you need to remove the driver, use:

```cmd
sc delete <drivername>
```

**Note:** Ensure that the driver is stopped before attempting to delete it, as active drivers cannot be removed.


[Detailed guide on using `sc create` for service creation](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/sc-create)

To verify the functionality of your driver and capture debug output, you can
use [DebugView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/debugview) in administrator mode.  
By recording kernel events, you can monitor the messages generated by functions like DbgPrint or KdPrint.

:::info
To enable the capture of debug output from your driver using DebugView, you need to configure the Debug Print Filter in
the Windows Registry.

Navigate to  
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Debug Print Filter`  
(you may need to create it).

Create a `DWORD` value named `DEFAULT` and set its value to `8`.  
After making these registry changes, it's necessary to restart the computer for the modifications to take effect.

Additionally, you can confirm the successful installation of your driver by checking the Windows Registry.  
Specifically, navigate to `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services` and look for the entry corresponding to
your driver name. A valid installation should result in the presence of the driver's registry entry at this location
