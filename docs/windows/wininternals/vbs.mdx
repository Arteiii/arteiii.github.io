# Virtualization-based security (VBS)

With Virtualization-based Security (VBS) enabled, VTL-1 is available, which includes its own secure kernel operating in privileged processor mode  
(for x86/x64 it is ring-0) and an isolated user mode (IUM), which operates in unprivileged mode (ring-3).

    In this particular design, an independent binary file called securekernel.exe exists as the secure kernel on the disk. The security environment, IUM, is also present which restricts the permitted system calls and includes unique security system calls that can be executed under VTL-1. The functions can be accessed through an internal system library dubbed Iumdll.dll, which is the VTL-1 form of Ntdll.dll, as well as through a Windows subsystem library referred to as Iumbase.dll, which is the VTL-1 edition of Kernelbase.dll. <br /><br />Copy-on-write practices prohibit VTL-0 applications from modifying binaries utilized by VTL-1. The VTL-1 kernel, which runs in both kernel mode and VTL-1, has full access to VTL-0 memory and resources. By utilizing CPU hardware support known as Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), the hypervisor can restrict VTL-0 OS access to specific memory locations. Credential Guard technology, which can store classified information in these locations, is based on SLAT.<br /><br /> The I/O memory management unit (MMU) virtualizes memory access for devices. this can be used to prevent device drivers from using direct memory access (DMA) to directly access the hypervisor or secure kernel physical areas of memory. this would bypass SLAT because no virtual memory is involved.<br /><br /> To ensure the protection of VTL-1 processes, the system has implemented trustlets. Trustlets are a special class of binaries, each with a unique identifier and signature. The secure kernel has hardcoded knowledge of all the trustlets created so far. As a result, it is impossible to create new trustlets without access to the secure kernel, which is only accessible by Microsoft.
