cd arteii.net

# Initialize the Nix environment
direnv allow

# Install dependencies and start the server
yarn install
yarn start

```

### Option B: Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
gh repo clone Arteiii/arteii.net
cd arteii.net

yarn start

```

**Available Yarn Commands:**

* `yarn start`: Starts the development server.
* `yarn build`: Builds the production site.
