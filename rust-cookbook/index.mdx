# Rust Cookbook

:::info Disclaimer
Most of the content here is originally from the [Rust Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/), a great resource that sadly is no longer actively maintained. Many examples in the original repository are outdated, so I’ve taken the liberty of publishing updated and improved versions here.

In addition to the refreshed content, you'll also find new material I’ve discovered to be particularly helpful, as well as explanations of some core concepts within the Rust ecosystem.

**Contributions Welcome!**
