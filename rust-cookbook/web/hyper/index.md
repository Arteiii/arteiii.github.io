# hyper

At the foundation of both [Axum](../axum/index.md) and [Tower](../tower/index.md) is Hyper, 
a low-level HTTP implementation in Rust that excels in both client and server contexts. 
Known for its high performance, Hyper handles multiple connections concurrently without blocking, 
making it an excellent choice for projects that demand raw HTTP capabilities. 
If you need to build an HTTP client or a server that can handle significant traffic, Hyper provides the control and efficiency you need.
